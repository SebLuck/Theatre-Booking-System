# Theatre-Booking-System-C++
This program is on a theatre booking system to store details of multiple types of events: live music, stand-up comedy and films.  
The live music events are standing only, but films and stand-up comedy are both seated.  
Stand-up comedy shows have allocated seating. Films do not have allocated seats, but they may
be either 2D or 3D. The venue has a capacity of 200 seated or 300 standing.
